# Twengine
Twengine aka twin engine is a game engine/framework used to make 2D games in C++

- [Install](#install)

## Install
**Currently twengine is not ready to be used at all. But if you still widh to play with it follow along**

Twengine has a simple Setup.sh script you can use

```
-- Using Setup.sh --
-- This will build and run the engine and demo --
$ ./Setup.sh

-- Without running the demo --
-- nr is just short for norun. Both work --
$ ./Setup.sh nr or norun

-- If you don't trust Setup.sh you can do all the steps yourself --
-- All the steps you need to do is in the Setup.sh :D --
```
